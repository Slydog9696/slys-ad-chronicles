Then there is all of the profile icons and banners and some other stuff there as well. All of the stuff mentioned here in this paragraph...

My Statement:
It looks like all the needed folders and possibly all the needed files has been built. It is possible that all of the content has been placed. However, there was multiple restarts to the chat one of them involved me having to re-paste in a previous chat that had disappeared. There was also a restart of the build after Windows Update interrupted and restarted my PC. Then there was a couple more restarts after Internet connections issues. So I am asking you to please look back through and make sure nothing is missing or left out that was a part of the plan in the copied abstractions that I have pasted above. I think there might be some minute things missing that I thought may have been pulled from Assets to provide all of my experience and certifications listed on multiple resumes and college transcript. There is one thing for sure I did see was where Firebase 'Data Connect' was mentioned along with the other Firebase services, but I do not think it was added during the site creation. Please review all the information above to make sure that all of my Assets, experiences, certifications, etc are accounted for. Also review all the information to see if anything was state that it was going to be created or implemented and it was not. If something is found not to be created or implemented please make it. After it has been verified that nothing else has been missed, please go back through the Next JS site and check for any errors including instructions on how to build and deploy a Next JS site. Fix any related files that need more content or have syntax issues, add any more needed components or libraries and the check everything again including any shell scripts or batch files that might need to be updated. Thank You.
